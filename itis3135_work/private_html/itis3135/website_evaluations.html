		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
		<h3>Website #1: <a href="https://www.honda.com/">Honda.com</a></h3>
		<p> - Honda's website is a good example of what a user-friendly and eye-catching website should be.
            As you navigate Honda.com you are greeted with smooth animations when you hover, scroll, and click.
            You can tell the site is updated often and fufils modern standards. The site is visually captivating
            including many of their products (mostly vehichles) and links to other pages that explain their features
            At the bottom of their site there are many lists to differnet pages, including their brands, about us, racing, recalls,
            and services. Overall Honda's website is consistent and follows CRAP to a tee.
        </p>

		<h3>Website #2: <a href="https://www.fogcam.org/">fogcam.org</a></h3>
		<p> - Fogcam.org is a perfect example of one of the ugliest websites I have ever seen. 
            The site has been up since 1994, and it looks like it hasn't been updated since 2001 (even though they say it was last updated 2021).
            When you finally load the site you are met with and ugly default-white background and a nasty
            bright orange color on some of the text. The camera is also in terrible contrast, of course it is the oldest webcam so there's not
            much you can do. The border around the camera looks like a windows 7 pop up, dull gray and black borders.
            The whole website is center text, big no no. The links are ugly, the list is ugly, and the font is too small.
            Overall the site is so basic and yet so ugly, I could create this in 10 minutes and probably make it better.
        </p>

		<h3>CRAP Principles Assessment: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Contrast: </strong><br>- Honda.com: The contrast on this site is extremely well made. they went for nice shades of red, white, and blue.
                These colors displayed are not too bright and not too dark, they give off a warm feeling making you
                feel welcome and excited to explore the site. The fonts on the site go well together, they use the 
                Honda brand font for most of their titles, the other fonts are simple, modern, and good size which makes for an easy read.
                within Honda's site there are many different rectangles whith images inside them, which zoom in if you hover over them, and take you
                to a external link if you click them. The rectangles are mostly good size and not occupying too much space.<br>
                 - Fogcam.org: The contrast on this site consist of: white background, some orange text, some black text, and blue links, thats it...
                Contrast might be the worst category for this site as it is very ugly and defualt. The only "image" on the site is
                the constantly updating webcam which is poor quality and high contrast. lastly to top it off most of the font is too small. 
            </li>
            <br>
			<li><strong>Repetition: </strong><br> - Honda.com: Honda's website has a consistent design pattern 
                and layout throughout its pages. The header and navigation menu remain the same 
                across pages, providing a familiar experience which is easier for users. You can tell 
                the page belongs to honda and utilizes repitition to state their brand. <br> - Fogcam.org: the site doesn't follow a design pattern or layout. 
                It is an extremely simple, single-page website with the poor webcam feed as the main content. To be fair it could be considered consistent due its simplicity.            
            </li>
            <br>
			<li><strong>Alignment: </strong><br> - Honda.com: The elements on Honda's website are very well-organized. The text, images, and other elements are simple, contributing to a visually pleasing and user-friendly design.
                <br> - Fogcam.org: The alignment of text and images is centered, which gives it an organized look.
            </li>
            <br>
			<li><strong>Proximity: </strongb><br>- Honda.com: Honda's website places relative elements close to each other. Product information, pricing, and images of Honda vehicles are grouped together logically. This helps users find the information they need efficiently.
                <br> - Fogcam.org: Generally speaking the elements on the website are spaced well. The webcam is the central focus, and other elements like it's name and information are placed near the top and bottom of the page.
            </li>
