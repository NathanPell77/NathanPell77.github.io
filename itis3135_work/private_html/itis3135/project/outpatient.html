                <h1>OUTPATIENT VISITS</h1>
                <br>
                <p> An Outpatient is a patient who receives medical treatment without being admitted to a hospital. Being an outpaitent is
                <br>quite literally the opposite of an inpatient because it requires treatment that can be provided without staying overnight.
                <br>It is likely that any outpatient at a hospital is there because the were an inpatient. The most common outpatient
                <br>visits consist of chest pain, severe allergies, skin issues, back pain, and follow-up exams. Outpatient visits  
                <br>should last anywhere between as little as 15 minutes to as long as 4-5 hours
                </p>
